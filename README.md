### Hey there, I'm Rie.

I write software, mostly related to Discord modding. I'm also [Available To Hire](https://megu.dev)!

## moonlight / Vencord Launcher
Launch moonlight or Vencord without having to patch your Discord client. Want to run modded? Run it with one-click through the launcher! Want to run vanilla Discord? Just run Discord normally! No hassle, no fuss.

## Discord ModLoader
A much more generalised version of the above - Run any Discord client mod (such as Vencord, Moonlight, BetterDiscord, shelter, etc.) without ever needing to patch the Discord client. Saving you the pain of patching/unpatching/updating whenever the client or mod updates.

## DPacker
A webpack debundler, primarily made for splitting & beautifying webpack modules for easy reading & parsing. Specifically targets Discord, but works for most other webpack sites.

## JSX Reconstructor
Convert webpack/minified react code back into valid JSX.

## Discord Build Logger
Logging all Discord builds, currently undergoing a rewrite.

## Discord Experiments Enabler
A small script you can paste into your Discord client to enable experiments without needing a client mod. Effects stay until you reload the client.
